            <h1>Hello, my name is Jacek </h1>
            <p> I was always passionate about understanding reality and how we interact with it and why.
                This brought me among other things to study game development. In my opinion, the process of creating engaging games is some sort
                of a venture trying to model part of our own life and cloth it as a fascinating new idea so we can live in another dimension and enrich our
                normal existence. I was a game enthusiast since early childhood, my first game were adventures created in Spore with my brother.
                Later although my educational career kind of steered away in a bizarre way, I continued to develop personal projects and attended
                game jams. I worked in Unity3D, Godot Engine and Unreal Engine 4 and 5. I am passionate about solving problems, bringing ideas to life,
                cognitive science, human biology, programming, artificial intelligence, overcoming personal limitations and learning languages.
